  "description": "Benefit from the best observability insights available. LLM-powered agents are only as smart as their data. Without deep observability data, agents are often unable to detect root causes and resolve issues. Connect them to Dynatrace using MCP to securely access and interact with real-time data in context. Enhance accuracy, minimize hallucinations, and ensure AI decisions are grounded in real-time production data for faster, more informed remediation. Automate fixes, accelerate MTTR, and scale insights across your agent ecosystem, while supporting enterprise-grade security for Dynatrace AI agents with built-in authentication and session isolation.",
