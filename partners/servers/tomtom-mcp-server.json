  "description": "The TomTom MCP Server is a managed server that acts as a standardized, low-latency conduit, providing AI systems with essential, real-time TomTom geospatial data to overcome spatial and temporal blindness.\n\nKey Functionalities:\n1. Search & Geocoding: Converts addresses/locations into precise coordinates, performs reverse lookups, and executes fuzzy searches for points of interest (POIs) globally.\n2. Multi-Modal Routing: Calculates optimized routes for various transportation methods, including driving, cycling, and walking, enabling complex door-to-door journey planning.\n3. Real-Time Traffic Context: Provides current Traffic Incidents and flow data for making dynamic, effective route decisions, rerouting, and generating predictive Estimated Times of Arrival (ETAs).\n4. Visual Context (Static Maps): Generates visual representations (static map images) of routes or locations for reporting, workflow consumption, or human verification.\n\nTypical Scenarios:\n- Logistics & Delivery Optimization: An AI system plans and adjusts delivery routes in real time based on current traffic to meet promised delivery windows.\n- Ride-Hailing/Mobility Services: An agent calculates optimized, multi-modal travel paths for users, integrating driving, walking, or public transport segments.\n- Emergency Response/Field Service: Automatically locating incident addresses and calculating the quickest route for field agents or first responders.\n- Workflow Automation: Generating static map images for a human reviewer to quickly verify a route or location before a task is executed.\n\nThe TomTom MCP Server is currently available in Beta (Public Preview).",
